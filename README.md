## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result. By default, the application will navigate to http://localhost:3000/research-tasks.

On the Research Tasks page, you can configure filters and click the Start Research button. This action will redirect you to http://localhost:3000/leaderboard, where you can view a table of influencers.

From the leaderboard, clicking on an influencer's rank will take you to their profile page at http://localhost:3000/influencer/{id}.
